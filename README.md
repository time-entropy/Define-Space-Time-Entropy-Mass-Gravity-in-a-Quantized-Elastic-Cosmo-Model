## Define-Space-Time-Entropy-Mass-Gravity-in-a-Quantized-Elastic-Cosmo-Model

This model proposes a common platform to  reconcile the interconnection of space,time,entropy,mass,and gravity.

 Inspired by the Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ) hypothesis, we model spacetime as a dynamic network of quantized units whose state transitions generate entropy (via multiplicative entropy S = ∏mᵢ), while local symmetry-breaking (SU(3) and Higgs mechanisms) couples mass and gravity. Key innovations include:

 ### 1. Space as a topologically homeomorphic quantum-elastic network woven by SEQs with elastic bonds

 ### 2. Time’s arrow as irreversible SEQ network transformations.

 ### 3. Mass emerging from compressed space-energy storage.

 ### 4. Gravity as SEQ network deformation.

 ### 5. Entropy as a causal coordinate. 

 ### 6. The model resolves singularities and predicts chiral asymmetry in leptons.
